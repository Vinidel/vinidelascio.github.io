I'm Vinicius Delascio — a software engineer who cares deeply about how we build software, not just what we build.

I spend my time thinking about:

- **AI-assisted development** — how to integrate AI into engineering workflows without losing architectural control
- **Structured workflows** — stage-gated processes that keep complex projects on track
- **Developer experience** — making it easier to ship quality work sustainably

I believe the best engineering isn't about moving fast. It's about moving *sustainably* — with clarity, discipline, and the right amount of structure.

## This site

I write here about lessons learned from real projects — the workflows, tools, and mental models that help me build better software.
